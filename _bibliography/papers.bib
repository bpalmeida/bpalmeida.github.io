abstract = {Session types provide a typing discipline for structured communication on bidirectional channels. Context-free session types overcome the restriction to tail recursive protocols characteristic of conventional session types. This extension enables the serialization and deserialization of tree structures in a fully type-safe manner. We present the theory underlying the language FreeST 2, which features context-free session types in an extension of System F with linear types and a kinding system to distinguish message types, session types, and channel types. The system presents metatheoretical challenges which we address: contractivity in the presence of polymorphism, a non-trivial equational theory on types, and decidability of type equivalence. We also establish standard results on typing preservation, progress, and a characterization of erroneous processes.}

  abstract  = {Session types describe patterns of interaction on communicating channels. Traditional session types include a form of choice whereby servers offer a collection of options, of which each client picks exactly one. This sort of choice constitutes a particular case of separated choice: offering on one side, selecting on the other. We introduce mixed choices in the context of session types and argue that they increase the flexibility of program development at the same time that they reduce the number of synchronisation primitives to exactly one. We present a type system incorporating subtyping and prove preservation and absence of runtime errors for well-typed processes. We further show that classical (conventional) sessions can be faithfully and tightly embedded in mixed choices. Finally, we discuss algorithmic type checking and a runtime system built on top of a conventional (choice-less) message-passing architecture.}

  abstract={FreeST is an experimental concurrent programming language. Based on a core linear functional programming language, it features primitives to fork new threads, and for channel creation and communication. A powerful type system of context-free session types governs the interaction on channels. The compiler builds on a novel algorithm for deciding type equivalence of context-free session types. This abstract provides a gentle introduction to the language and discusses the validation process and runtime system.}
