>I am a Ph.D. student at the [Faculty of
>Sciences](https://www.ciencias.ulisboa.pt) of the University of Lisbon.
>Currently, I am working at the [LASIGE](https://www.lasige.di.fc.ul.pt/)
>research unit where my research topics are, mainly, programming languages, type
>systems, and session types.
>
>I am interested in programming languages in general but, right now, I am
>principally focused on working with session types. This interest came when I
>understood the importance of structuring all kinds of communication that occur
>in concurrent programs. One thing that arouses my interest in this matter is
>that we can ensure, at compile-time, that there are no communications issues.
>Moreover, we can also guarantee the absence of race conditions and some other
>properties. I consider those as essential attributes to all concurrent
>programming languages.
>
> At the moment, I am working on [FreeST](http://rss.di.fc.ul.pt/tools/freest/),
> which is a concurrent programming language where processes communicate via
> message-passing. The language features bi-directional channel-based
> communication.
